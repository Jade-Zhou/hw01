## A brief introduction of me
My name is *Jue Zhou* (The "e" is pronounced here as /e/. You could also call me Jade because my name means Jade in Chinese.) 

I come from southeast China and I did my undergrad at Peking University. Now I am a MAPSS student at Uchicago and I am in sociology concentration. My research interests generally lie in the area of gender and politics. To be more specific, I focus on the changes of gender roles in the rising of nation states. 

* My hobbies
  + reading novels (Jane Austin, Eileen Chang and Ursula K. LeGuin)
  + watching movies (My favorite director is Kie≈õlowski.)
  + visiting museums
